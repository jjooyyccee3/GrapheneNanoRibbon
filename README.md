Band Structure of Graphene Nanoribbons (GNRs)

This repository contains the numerical implementation and analytical verification of the Tight-Binding Model to study the electronic properties of graphene and Graphene Nanoribbons (GNRs). This project was developed for the Computational Physics course at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU).
